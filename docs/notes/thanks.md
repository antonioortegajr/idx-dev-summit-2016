##thanks

So that wraps up the Workshop. I hope you all got something out of
listening to me ramble for this long. Again all of this workshop,
from the slides, code examples and even the notes I have been reading are
expand on what I have shown.
More than that, over the next month these will start
 to become lessons in developers.idxbroker.com. This will allow any support
 or developer staff to take the lessons they want with out having to search
through a whole github repo. Of course stars, watching, forks and pulls encouraged.
Even issues (Brandon). JK
 I really want everyone here to leave with more
than just a day of material and notes. Instead I am looking to provide
all the resources today for you.

Before we get to any questions I wanted
to be sure we had a little time to thank everyone that helped make this
event happen the way it did today. It takes a lot of people to throw up
 an event. It takes a lot of planning and execution for this to work out well.
  I think we did it again.


If we can go to the slides gist again.

First up I want to thank Tim. this is him and he is in the IT department.
He helped me in the set up of the workshop today as well as all audio
equipment and etc.. that allowed us to communicate efficiently today.
Thank you for putting up with me Tim.

Next I want to thank Jason. He got the twig templating system working.
He has really wanted to build this for some time and it didn't get into a
a development sprint. He helped make this a priority this year and got it
working for us. Thank Jason.

I also want to thank Tina. She made all the gift bags and did all the labels
for the API IPAs. IF you called into IDX before you might have spoken to her.
If you call in later let her know the gift bags were great.

I want to thank Dave. His work on Equity has led the way for the API methods we
now test and develop with. Throwing challenges at him and seeing what upset him
 proved so valuable in working out kinks before we turned this over to our
 developer partners.

 Of course thank to every IDX er here today. Alec for making the promo videos.
 Richard's awesome beer labels.
  All on the panel and of course Chad.

 Finally thanks to everyone of you that came to Portland today. This group
  has played a large role in building the community that is this developer
  network. I have seen this channel transform from a "IDX reseller" to a
  IDX community of partners. Complete with collaboration, peer support, and
  feature creations.  At IDX we don't spend a lot of time comparing ourselves
  to other IDX solutions, but I am going to. No other IDX solution has this.
  That because of all of you. So thanks for that. Again please feel free to
  be social and share thoughts about your experience today. Hashtag idxdev and
  the optional hashtag #giveantonioapayrasie. Thank for coming to Portland.
