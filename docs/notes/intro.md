## Welcome back from Lunch

Lunch was a lot of fun. But now I am here to bore you with code stuffs.
 So if everyone can fire up laptops we can begin.

 While everyone is setting back up and logging in I will introduce myself.

 My name is Antonio. I am the developer partner channel manger at IDX Broker.

If it has to do with our developer partners I am probably involved.

I see familiar faces out here and some I have never met before.

I am pretty accessible. You can always email me at antonio@idxbroker.com

Or hit me up on social. twitter, facebook, linkedin, all of them pretty much.
My handle is always antonioortegajr all one word. Any support stuffs should go to
developers@idxbroker.com where Nick or I will answer. Finally I also have an
unofficial slack channel called idxdev. If you are on slack and want in, let me know
via any of the methods I just mentioned.

Last year was our first run at this. We had no idea what to expect.
It all turned out really great and we learned a lot about this partner network
 of developers. After that there was no way we were not going to do this again.

 Thanks to everyone that came last year and showed us how cool this event really was.

So last year part of the feedback we got was more code and features.
That is what we are doing today. I can't tell you how happy I was to hear our partners
so interested in the technologies we use everyday as IDX developers. I like to nerd out
on this stuff too.

This is why we are devoting the last half of today to a coding workshop.

We are going to look at existing IDX technology in details pages and apply javascript.
After that we are going to look at the future of details pages and how you are involved.
We are also going to do API calls right here. The API already offers a lot of
potential to build features for clients. And today we are going to look at the basics of those
 calls and brand new calls.

 In the end you will have applied javascript and run php a few times over.

 So this is going to be fun.

If you already know JS or PHP really well there still should be some new stuff you.

If everyone can open up a browser. I suggest Chrome.

Go to this IP and port to get to the console I have prepared.

This is a console much like JSfiddle or codepen if you are familiar with
these services. You enter code on the left and this is rendered on the right.

This how I want to present you with code. I kind of hate code on slides as you can
never really read it. When you can it's a snippet and you lose the ability to
understand the larger picture.

Instead today each machine here will run it's own console and not only be able to read
all code, but run all code. If you have not run javascript or php ever, today you will.

All code will be provided and we will pause for a few min for you to just
play with the code on this console.

If you are like me you might be thinking, can I break this with code?

The answer is yes you can.

Please please don't.

I trust that we are all here to have a good nerd time so I don't have any safety
precautions keeping you from re writing all the files or
even just deleting the files that make this work.

Again I am going to simply trust everyone here that knows how to break this
to not do so.

So in the console we see a few buttons.

File will allow us to enter a link to import. These imports will be code. Clear will clear
 the left side of any code. Run will run any code on the left side
 so it renders on the right.

 Copying any of the gists will reach out to github and copy the code in the gist.

 There is an option for download, but its not really needed as all code and all
  of the notes I am looking at will be available in my GitHub repository.

  You don't have to be on GitHub to get this repo, but I like GitHub so I suggest it.

  Let's start by clicking the default gist copy button. This will copy to your clipboard.
  Click file and import then paste in the gist url from you clipboard. Click OK

  Now we have code on the left. Click run to render on the right.

  You should see my smiling face and a few boxes. There might alignment issues

  you can adjust the size of each side by placing your mouse on the dividing line and moving
  this left or right. I am sorry for lack of 100% responsiveness.

  There is a tweet button you can use at anytime to tweet about this experience or
topics we are discussing.

Remember that any tweets about things we are showing today go out to the twittersphere.

You may not want to tweet about some our new feature examples just yet. Or you might.

 Up to you.

 We are importing this code first because it contains copy buttons to each lesson.
 Think of this as the main menu. If you start to explore coding in the console and create
 something that will no longer run, you can always get back to the lesson by re importing this code and copying the lesson you need to re import.

 We will import code many times. This is to avoid typing new code. Also to give time for
 experimenting with code in this console.

 Any questions on the console? Please ask questions any time. This is not a lecture.

 Now that we know how this console works we can get started before we do are there any
 questions so far?
