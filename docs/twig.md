Basic usage

Create templates with html and variables. Variables are declared using double curly braces.
Example:
'<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1>{{ variable }}</h1>
<p>The above curly braces will be filled in with whatever is defined as variable</p>
</body>
</html>'

templates can then be used with twig to offer pages based on dynamic data.
